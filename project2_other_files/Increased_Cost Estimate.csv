With the increased budget the VPC number connections were upgraded (250) to ensure functionality of the service in case of high demands. Also the EC2 instances for Web Servers have been upgraded to a higher class in order to be able to serve a higher demand. The RDS type of instance and size have also been increased in order to face a higher load.;
